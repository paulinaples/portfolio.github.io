  <p>My name is Paulina Gomez, and I’m a 24-year-old content creator from Naples, Florida. I have a background in digital media and communications, and I’m currently pursuing my graduate degree at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School. My family is from Colombia, and I’m passionate about creating video content that tells meaningful stories—whether that’s for luxury watch brands or local businesses. In my free time, I enjoy watching boxing and MMA, making creative videos, and spending time with friends.

  <h2>My Professional Career:  </h2>
</p>
I’m Paulina Gomez, a video content creator with a passion for storytelling through visuals. I got my BA in Communication and Conflict from the University of Central Florida, and I’m currently earning my master’s at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School, focusing on digital media and communication.

Professionally, I create video content for a luxury watch retailer where I handle everything from product features to creative brand storytelling. I love highlighting the craftsmanship behind these timepieces and making content that connects with both watch enthusiasts and new audiences.

Outside of that, I’ve started my own business called PGC Productions. Through it, I help local businesses and individuals bring their ideas to life—whether that’s a promo video for a brand, or capturing moments at weddings, birthdays, or sporting events.
I’m especially passionate about combat sports like boxing and MMA, and my goal is to one day create media content for companies like the UFC or major boxing promotions. I love working at the intersection of creativity, culture, and communication—and I’m always looking for new ways to grow in this space.<ul>
